Mirage is a stateful API mock server for integration testing.

Define a partner's API as a YAML file, run `mirage start`, and you get a fully functional
mock server — no code changes required to add new partners or endpoints.

## Why Mirage?

Tools like WireMock, Postman, and Mockoon mock individual HTTP responses. Real partner APIs
don't work that way: they require a specific call sequence, return `202 Accepted` before data
is available, and expect you to poll or wait before fetching a result. Testing against a
stateless stub hides these interaction bugs until you hit production. Mirage models the full
interaction sequence — submit, poll, fetch — so your integration tests reflect what actually
happens when your code talks to a real partner API.

## How it works

- **Partner definitions** live in `partners/<name>/partner.yaml`. Each file declares the
  partner's endpoints, the interaction pattern each endpoint follows, and the expected
  response shape.
- **Patterns** capture common API interaction models:
  - `oauth` — client-credentials token endpoint that returns a static JWT.
  - `static` — endpoint that always returns a fixed JSON body defined in the YAML.
  - `fetch` — synchronous GET that returns the stored payload for a datapoint, with optional session isolation.
  - `poll` — three-step async flow: submit (POST) → poll for readiness (HEAD) → fetch result (GET).
  - `push` — Mirage proactively delivers a payload to a callback URL (future).
- **Payload storage** supports two modes:
  - *Global* — one payload per datapoint, last write wins.
  - *Session* — isolated payload per test run, selected via `X-Mirage-Session` header.
- **Admin API** is always available at `/mirage/admin/` for uploading payloads and
  inspecting sessions.

### Interaction sequence (poll pattern)

Test Harness                       Mirage
     |                               |
     |  POST /admin/.../payload      |   (upload the response payload)

```

## Quick start

**With Docker (recommended):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edu2105/mirage.git
cd mirage
docker compose up
```

**Without Docker:**

Requires Python 3.11 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edu2105/mirage.git
cd mirage
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
mirage start
```

Expected output:
```
Starting Mirage on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

See what endpoints are available (no server needed):
```bash
mirage routes
```

## Patterns

### `oauth`

Returns a static JWT-shaped response. Use for standard OAuth 2.0 client-credentials token endpoints.

```yaml
- name: token
  pattern: oauth
  endpoints:
    - method: POST
      path: /oauth/token
      response:
        status: 200
        token_type: Bearer
        expires_in: 3600
```

Response body:
```json
{ "access_token": "<static-jwt>", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 3600 }
```

### `static`

Returns whatever JSON body is defined under `response.body` in the YAML. Use for
non-standard auth endpoints, health checks, or any fixed response.

```yaml
- name: token
  pattern: static
  endpoints:
    - method: POST
      path: /bookingco/auth/token
      response:
        status: 200
        body:
          token: "static-token-replace-in-real-use"
```

### `fetch`

Single GET endpoint that returns the stored payload for the datapoint. Supports
`X-Mirage-Session` for test isolation. Use for synchronous read endpoints.

```yaml
- name: charges
  pattern: fetch
  endpoints:
    - method: GET
      path: /bookingco/v1/charges
      response:
        status: 200
```

Upload a payload first, then GET returns it:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mirage/admin/bookingco/charges/payload \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"charges": [{"id": "C1", "amount": 150}]}'

curl http://localhost:8000/bookingco/v1/charges
```

### `poll`

Three-step async flow: submit → poll for readiness → fetch result. Use for partners
that return `202 Accepted` and require polling.

```yaml
- name: reservation
  pattern: poll
  endpoints:
    - step: 1
      method: POST
      path: /staylink/reservations
      response:
        status: 202
        location_template: /staylink/reservations/{uuid}
    - step: 2
      method: HEAD
      path: /staylink/reservations/{uuid}
      response:
        status: 201
        headers:
          Status: COMPLETED
    - step: 3
      method: GET
      path: /staylink/reservations/{uuid}
      response:
        status: 200
```

## Session-isolated testing

Any `fetch` or `poll` endpoint supports session isolation via `X-Mirage-Session`.

```bash
# Upload a session-scoped payload — returns a session_id
SESSION=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/mirage/admin/bookingco/charges/payload/session \
               -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
               -d '{"charges": [{"id": "S1"}]}' | jq -r .session_id)

# Use the session in your request
curl http://localhost:8000/bookingco/v1/charges -H "X-Mirage-Session: $SESSION"
```

Multiple test users can run in parallel with isolated payloads — each gets their own `session_id`.

## Admin endpoints

For every datapoint, Mirage auto-generates:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/mirage/admin/{partner}/{datapoint}/payload` | Upload global payload |
| `GET`  | `/mirage/admin/{partner}/{datapoint}/payload` | Inspect current global payload |
| `POST` | `/mirage/admin/{partner}/{datapoint}/payload/session` | Upload session payload → returns `session_id` |
| `GET`  | `/mirage/admin/{partner}/{datapoint}/payload/session/{session_id}` | Inspect a session payload |

Fixed infra endpoints:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/mirage/admin/partners` | List all loaded partners and their datapoints |
| `GET` | `/mirage/admin/sessions` | List all active sessions |

### Securing admin endpoints

By default admin endpoints are open — suitable for local development only.
When deploying on a shared network, protect them with a Bearer token:

```bash
# via environment variable (recommended)
MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY=your-secret-key mirage start

# or as a CLI flag
mirage start --admin-key your-secret-key
```

All `/mirage/admin/*` requests then require:
```
Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key
```

Consumer endpoints (`/oauth/token`, partner routes, etc.) are never affected.
Set `MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY` in `docker-compose.yml` for Docker deployments.

## CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mirage start` | Load all partner YAMLs and start the server (`--admin-key` / `MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY` to protect admin endpoints) |
| `mirage status` | Show active sessions in the store |
| `mirage routes` | List all consumer and admin endpoints per partner (no server needed) |
| `mirage payload get <partner> <datapoint>` | Print the current global payload |
| `mirage payload set <partner> <datapoint> <file>` | Upload a global payload from a JSON file |
| `mirage sessions clear` | Delete all sessions from the store |

## Docker

The `partners/` directory and `data/` (SQLite db) are volume-mounted — partners
can be added without rebuilding the image, and state persists across restarts.

```bash
docker compose up                   # start
docker compose restart              # reload after adding a partner YAML
docker compose down                 # stop (data persists in ./data/)
docker compose down -v              # stop and wipe all state
```

The container binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To expose it on the network,
update `docker-compose.yml` and set an admin key:

```yaml
ports:
  - "0.0.0.0:8000:8000"
environment:
  MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY: "your-secret-key"
```

## Deploy to the cloud

Always set `MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY` when deploying outside localhost.

**Railway**

Create a project, attach a volume mounted at `/app/data`, and set `PARTNERS_DIR` if
your partner YAMLs are not committed to the repo. Deploy with:

```bash
railway up
```

Set `MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY` in the Railway environment variables dashboard.
If you store partners in the repo, the `partners/` directory is included in the deploy
automatically. For a persistent SQLite database, mount a volume at `/app/data` and point
Mirage at it with `--db /app/data/mirage.db` via the start command.

**Render**

Create a new Web Service using the Docker runtime. Add a persistent disk mounted at
`/app/data`. Set the start command to `mirage start --db /app/data/mirage.db --host 0.0.0.0`.
Set `MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY` in the environment variables panel. Render rebuilds the image on
each push; partners committed to the repo are available immediately after deploy.

**Any Linux VM (EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edu2105/mirage.git
cd mirage
# Set your admin key in docker-compose.yml or as an env var, then:
MIRAGE_ADMIN_KEY=your-secret-key docker compose up -d
```

Put Nginx in front to terminate TLS and proxy to `127.0.0.1:8000`. The `partners/` and
`data/` directories are volume-mounted, so adding a partner or backing up state requires
no container access.

## Adding a new partner

Create a directory under `partners/` with a `partner.yaml` file — no code changes required.
See `partners/README.md` for the full authoring guide.

```
partners/
└── mypartner/
    ├── partner.yaml
    └── payloads/       # optional example payload files
```

Restart `mirage start` and the new partner's endpoints are live.

## Limitations & Roadmap

- `push` pattern is not yet implemented — Mirage cannot proactively deliver payloads to a callback URL.
- No native HTTPS support — use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) to terminate TLS.
- No web UI — all admin interactions are via the REST API or CLI.
- XML response bodies are not supported — responses are always JSON.
- No built-in mTLS support.
- Single-node only — the SQLite session store is not shared across instances.

## Contributing

**Run the test suite:**
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

**Add a new pattern:**
Patterns live in `mirage/engine/patterns/`. Each pattern is a module that registers one or
more FastAPI route handlers given an `EndpointDef`. Look at `fetch.py` or `poll.py` for the
interface — the router calls `register(app, partner, datapoint, endpoint, store)` for each
endpoint whose pattern matches. Add your module there and wire it into `router.py`.

**Add a new partner:**
No code required — write a `partner.yaml` under `partners/<name>/`. The full schema and
field reference is in `partners/README.md`.
